# Vleesie Webshop

Vleesie Webshop is a simple, selfmade webshop. This project was mainly foccused on learning the language php and make a webshop with it.

## Some features

- Main page with all the products
- In debt product page
- Registration and login functionality
- A simple shopping cart system where you can add products and remove them
- Updating the amount of the product in the shopping cart

Note that this website is not responsible and it will not be. This is made quickly with UIKit and mainly focussed on the backend of the shop.

We made this in vanilla php and used MySQL for the database. I setup a dockerfile because I wanted to try docker as well.
Be aware that some functions are not fully working for some browers. I made a simple function for the scroll position that stays in place, but it will not work smooth with firefox.
